Translate specified documents written in English into Korean, ensuring strict adherence to meaning and formatting.

- **Do not translate** text within code blocks or mermaid code diagrams; leave these sections in their original English.
- Retain key terms in English if they are better understood without translation.
- Ensure the output file is placed in the same location as the input file. The output filename must be the same as the input file name but with "_kor" appended to the end.

- **Steps**
  1. Identify sections in the document that are within code blocks or mermaid diagrams and mark them to avoid translation.
  2. Translate the rest of the document from English to Korean, maintaining the original structure and formatting.
  3. Identify key terms that should remain untranslated and ensure they are left as is.
  4. Generate the translated document, preserving all original formatting elements and structure.
  5. Save the translated document in the designated location with the appropriate filename.

- **Output Format**
  - The translation should be in the same file format and structure as the input document, ensuring consistent formatting throughout. The filename should be output with "_kor" appended to the original filename.

- **Notes**
  - Pay special attention to maintaining the precision of technical or specific terminologies.
  - Ensure cultural nuances are considered during translation to preserve meaning while staying true to the original document's intent.

  - Double-check that no code blocks or diagrams have been accidentally altered or translated.

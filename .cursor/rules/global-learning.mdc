# Global Learning System

This rule serves two essential purposes:

1. **Reference Existing Knowledge**: Always check [what-i-learned.md](mdc:docs/implementation/what-i-learned.md) at the beginning of every conversation to prevent repeating documented mistakes.

2. **Record New Learnings**: Proactively identify and document new learnings, mistakes, and useful facts discovered during conversations.

## Always Reference What-I-Learned

Before providing advice or making suggestions about:
- Testing frameworks and approaches
- Project structure and organization
- Design patterns and architecture
- Environment setup and configuration
- Implementation details and best practices

Check [what-i-learned.md](mdc:docs/implementation/what-i-learned.md) first to ensure recommendations align with established knowledge and avoid repeating documented mistakes.

## Proactively Update What-I-Learned

When to update the document:
- When a user corrects a mistake in your advice or code
- When discovering important technical facts about the codebase
- When learning about environment-specific requirements
- When identifying anti-patterns or best practices
- When figuring out solutions to common problems
- When terminal environment or tool usage guidelines change

How to update the document:
1. Identify the category for the new learning
2. Format the learning as a clear, concise bullet point with necessary context
3. Use bold text to highlight key terms
4. Append the learning to the appropriate section in what-i-learned.md
5. If no appropriate section exists, create a new one with a clear heading

Format for new entries:
```markdown
## [Category Name]

- **[Key concept]** [Concise explanation of the learning with necessary context]
```

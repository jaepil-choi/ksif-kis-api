# Enhanced Taskmaster-AI Workflow

This rule defines a standardized workflow to be followed for every task when using Taskmaster-AI with Cursor. It ensures proper architecture understanding before implementation.

## Pre-Implementation Hook (Before Starting a Task)

Before starting work on any task with `set_task_status` to "in-progress", ALWAYS:

1. **Read Architecture Documentation** by examining these files:
   - Review all mermaid diagrams in `docs/vibe_docs/architecture/as-is/sysmacro4/`
   - Read the diagnosis report in the same directory
   - Understand the current structure of classes and packages in `src/sysmacro4/`

2. **After** reading documentation, write a brief summary of the current architecture as it relates to the task

## Implementation Phase

- Proceed with standard task implementation as defined by Taskmaster-AI
- Follow the task requirements, test strategy, and other guidance
- Run tests and check implementation quality throughout development
- Ensure code adheres to project architecture patterns
- Verify all tests pass before completing the task
- Update documentation if needed
